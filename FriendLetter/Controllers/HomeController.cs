// how does letter know which view directory to render? views directory is the first directory located by views(). within in autio locates a subdirectory whose name matches the controller name. Put letter route is in a home controller so it looks for a directory called home
// letter.cshtml name matches with letter() route. thats why naming is important

// Our Letter() route now does three things when invoked (that is, when a client sends a request to our root route, or, localhost:5000):
// It creates a new empty LetterVariable object named myLetterVariable.
// Using the SetRecipient() method defined in Models/LetterVariable.cs, it sets the _recipient property of this object to "Jessica".
// It passes this myLetterVariable object into the View() method as an argument. This ensures our corresponding Letter.cshtml view now has access to our LetterVariable object.

// Model Binding
// Remember how we used @Model.GetRecipient() in Letter.cshtml? MVC uses something called model binding to pass data from one part of an application to another. Instances of @Model in the view represent whatever we pass into View() as an argument on the corresponding route.
// In this case, we've passed the View() method in the Letter() route the object myLetterVariable as an argument. This means any instances of @Model in the Letter.cshtml view now represent myLetterVariable. So when we call @Model.GetRecipient() in Letter.cshtml, it's the same as calling myLetterVariable.GetRecipient().
// Letâ€™s check it out! We'll restart our server, visit http://localhost:5000, and see the name "Jessica" is now rendered in our view!
// But what if we wanted to send the letter to Lina instead? Well, we'd just change the argument provided to myLetterVariable.SetRecipient() in the Letter() route:
